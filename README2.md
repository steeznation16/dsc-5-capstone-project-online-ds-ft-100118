## Project: Seattle Washington, Summary

## Question: What Factors Influence Airbnb Reviews
### How do those reviews compare with locations of crime in the city?

## Goal: Visually Represent Locations of Airbnb Rentals Relative to Review, as well as Crime

## Data:

I gathered my data from Kaggle, and from searching different websites for data relating to Seattle, Washington.  The original data I started with was from the Pronto Cycle Share company's data set that was on Kaggle.com.  After starting by examining this data, I found date from Airbnb on Kaggle as well.  I initially found a dataset from Kaggle that had crime data from Seattle, WA, but I looked online and found other options, although ended up going to a different Kaggle dataset with 1.4 million responses from 2009 onwards.

* Airbnb Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)
* Seattle Police Department from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/seattle-police-department-911-incident-response#Seattle_Police_Department_911_Incident_Response.csv)
* Pronto Cycle Share Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pronto/cycle-share-dataset)

## Initial Thoughts:
While my initial goals for this project were reaching for the stars a bit, they were well-founded, albeit turned out to be much more difficult than initially anticipated.  My original goals for a final project were to have a dashboard where someone could see pricing of housing markets, as well as overall citizen/customer sentiment geared towards Airbnb and Criminal activity in seattle.  The goal was also to be able to relate cycle sharing trips to Airbnb and crime data, as today's society has grown more accustomed to using ride sharing companies, as well as cycle sharing and other forms of public transportation, especially in heavily populated cities such as Seattle.  While these are useful for those who work in the city and commute often, for those who live in the city, it is also a necessity in order to get around without personal transportation in the tight city streets.  If this data can be used in order to assist someone in their search of a new home or apartment, as well as perhaps for some to consider future markets for real estate development for new apartment complexes, or areas in need of better office parks.

While this did not come to fruition as originally imagined, I was still intrigued to have learned about the different areas that were hotspots for [Crime](<img src=http://localhost:8888/view/Module05/capstone/dsc-5-capstone-project-online-ds-ft-100118/Maps/final_crime.html>), Airbnb rentals, and cycle share locations.

## Visualizations:
#### Folium:
A lot of the visualizations in this project revolved around Folium and plotting points geographically on a map.  While the use of Folium can be slow to render and difficult to work with at times, the results are fantastic in the ability to plot points and see geographically where locations lie relative to each other.  There are also great ways to add different layers in order to toggle between certain data or certain ways of identifying such data on the map.
