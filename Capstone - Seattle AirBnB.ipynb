Our room was very cozy and the rest of the house is open & beautifully decorated - if we didn't have other plans it would have been easy to lounge there all day, especially with their friendly kitty! The farmhouse is located in a great neighborhood that is quite easy to access the city - because the weather was so wonderful during our stay, my friend & I walked to the downtown waterfront which only took about 35 minutes. I would highly recommend staying here - I will again when I return to Seattle.\",\n",

Very clean house and safe neighborhood. \\r\\n\\r\\nTheir cat is very friendly as well! Five star cat ^_^  \\r\\n\\r\\nRachel was very flexible about check out time.

We slept comfortably in the Corner room, that is simply furnished and a bit chilly at night, but also quite private and quiet.

Just like the photos! The only evidence of their cat was Brigitte herself. There wasn't any pet odor or hair to be found. The house has amazing natural lighting as well. But not to worry, the bedroom has a very heavy curtain for blocking out the morning sun for sleeping in as long as you please. The comfy bed was a great thing to come back to each night after a long day of exploring. Located in the Central District (literally central to everything), I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go and felt very safe doing so. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey have set the bar extremely high for any future Airbnb experiences. I will definitely try to book with Rachel and Jon the next time I travel to Seattle, and will recommend their listing to everyone I know! \",\n",

While we were out exploring most of our time there, we felt right at home and at ease where we were staying. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is just a mile walk (or cheap Uber ride) from downtown Seattle and the same for Capitol Hill area. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf cats are an issue - don't worry.   I can be sometimes sensitive to cat hair - but you would never know there was a cat in the house.  But she is super sweet but also not in the way if you don't want her to be - but she does like a good petting :)\",\n",

We were there in the middle of a heat wave but the house still kept cool, even though it was 95+ out we had no trouble even napping midday in our comfy room. They left treats and snack out and had a very friendly cat that we enjoyed napping with. We missed paths on the way in but met up on the way out and lo and behold we knew each other from high school! We had a great time sipping coffee and catching up and will definitely check back in for future Seattle trips.\",\n",
       " 'Rachel & Jon were incredible hosts! They were both very friendly, open, easy going and their hospitality was far more than I could have ever hoped for. They both offered tips of where to go, what to do, where to shop and how to find what I was looking for. They even shared the fruits of their labour blueberry picking, and helped me make coffee in the morning. It made my first weekend of school that much more enjoyable knowing I was returning to somewhere that felt like home.',\n",
       " \"This was my very first stay at an Airbnb and it was lovely.  I chose the Corner Room at the Farmhouse because of its proximity to my daughter's apartment.  Rachel & John were very nice and made me feel welcome in their home.  The bed was extremely comfortable, so I slept great, and I learned how to use the French Press to make coffee.  The house is clean and sunny in a nice neighborhood. \\r\\nI will definitely stay at The Corner Room again the next time I visit.\\r\\n\",\n",

My boyfriend and I really wanted to experience the coffee, beer, and food scene of Seattle, and Kelli covered it all perfectly!\\n\\nThe location was perfect and ideal for first timers in Seattle. Pike Place and the Seattle Center  (Space Needle and Chihuly) were just a short walk away.  Fremont was also a slightly longer walk north from Kelli's. Lastly, Kerri Park where you can receive one of the best views of the Seattle skyline was also very close!\\n\\nOverall Kelli was a phenomenal host and I highly recommend her for anyone visiting Emerald City!\",\n",

My wife and I had no problems sleeping with the futon that was folded out. It was surprisingly comfortable. Kelli provided pillows, towels, and everything we needed for the night.

Plus, Kelli had a map, and newspapers and lists of all the places to go to in Seattle ready for us as soon as we arrived. The location of Kelli's home is amazing! Just a few minutes walk away from major attractions, and steps away from bus lines. Walking distance to excellent restaurants. We loved our beautiful and very comfortable room. We slept very well, and we had no privacy issues at all. Kelli keeps her home impeccably clean and dust-free, which I really appreciated as an asthmatic. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time in Seattle thanks to Kelli and her beautiful home! And her doggy, Desi, was super cute and sweet.

The location couldn't have been better -- it's only a few blocks away from the iconic Space Needle and a slew of cultural hubs. There are fantastic restaurants steps away from the apartment and Kelli has recommendation dishes for all of them. In addition, there are multiple bus stops just around the corner to bring you to farther places for sightseeing. For example, the University of Washington and Arboretum was about 40 minutes away. \\n\\nKelli is just the sweetest, which is further proven by the scrumptious freshly baked cookies she offered me during my stay.

Space Needle, Key Arena, the monorail, etc). The room & bed were comfortable and true to the pictures. There was wifi and a tv for you to kick back and relax on the couch with. So if you want a place to have a nice hot shower and a good sleep after a long day out, this is a great place for you. \\n\\nIf you're lucky enough you'll also get to meet Charlie, who was such a friendly and lovable kitten - and we're normally not even cat people! :) \",\n",

The house is located in a residential neighborhood (quiet & safe), but not too far from downtown Seattle (20 min by bus or so?), the U district, Ballard, Wallingford...

My family stayed for 6 weeks in the summer, and it was a perfect home away from home.   very convenient to parks, buses, shopping, etc.  Note there is no TV, but grab a book and pot of tea, coffee, listen to music, play piano, and enjoy Seattle.\",\n",
       " \"The apartment was exactly as pictured, and we enjoyed the adorable Mapleleaf neighborhood.

Thanks Bonnie!\",\n",
       " \"Bonnie was available for check in and had definitely listened to the purpose of my trip and schedule and was ultra-accomodating to that. The apartment was exactly as pictured and described, but with extra hospitality. This feels like a Bohemian artists loft and is so comfortable and charming. You do not feel like you will break anything or can't touch and all the decorator and guest touches are just perfect! I hope Bonnie will welcome me back as this location is perfect for my office which is 1 mi away at Green Lake. The freeway access is easy and it's a nice neighborhood. And Thank You, Bonnie, for the little treats you left for us--especially coffee :)\",\n",
       " 'Check-in was a breeze. Bonnie was very responsive and had suggestions of things to do in Seattle over a holiday weekend. The space was cozy, and it was a very welcoming space for a family with children. There is a great coffee shop across the street, as well as a park within walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stayed at the apartment during a Seattle heat-wave, so the older building ended up being a little stuffy without A/C. Fans and open windows helped during the nights.',\n",

Overall we enjoyed our stay.\",\n",

You're only about 10 minutes from downtown Seattle, but the Maple Leaf neighborhood offers plenty of dining options if you don't want to be bothered with making the trek. The place was spacious, bright and clean with plenty of room for our family of 3. I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about not having a TV, but we whiled away our downtime listening to records or surfing the Internet via w-fi. So I guess you could say no complaints! Overall, a great AirBnB experience.\",\n",

Their home is conveniently located near a bus stop that makes it easy to get to and from the city, and neighborhood is close to the beach, and in a quiet safe setting.

As we stepped into the apartment we felt quickly like at home. This is a cozy apartment, clean and with good taste in decorations. Justin offered some fruit, beagles and orange juice, which were very much appreciated. The apartment itself is awesome and you will feel like you don't want to go out. We had planned to eat out every day, but in the end we bought some food at the nearby QFC and cooked at home several times. I particularly enjoyed the projector. If you have a netflix account you can enjoy movies in a home theater setting.  Neighborhood was also great, 5 minutes walking distance from many happening places, stores and bars, and 15 minutes (or less) walking to the Pike Market Place. I definitely recommend this Justin's apartment for a short of long stay in Seattle.  \",\n",

The furniture is classy and cozy, the bed is fantastic, kitchen is beautiful, and the home theater HD projector is awesome for throwing a movie up on the wall in what feels like your private movie theater.\\n\\nTo top it off, Justin was an ideal host. Before I arrived, he was extremely detailed and timely in his responses to my questions about parking options, wireless internet, etc. And once I arrived, I was welcomed with fresh bagels & cream cheese, fresh fruit and OJ. Plus, he had a clear home essentials instruction sheet, along with a Seattle tourism guide, both printed out and waiting for me on the kitchen counter.

       " 'Justin\\'s apartment is very nice. Well equipped kitchen. Newly decorated. Comfortable bed. Note about the bed: it is a foam mattress. We were concerned at first, but it turned out to be very supportive. We are older, 60+, but the mattress caused us no discomfort or next-day-soreness. The apartment is not as \"dark\" as it looks in the photos.  The big windows let in a lot of light. The views are basically of neighboring buildings, but you can see Mt Rainier (on a clear day, if you get one). The building is an older apartment building, but it has been well cared for. The neighbors were quiet and nice. Justin was very helpful and responsive.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the location: we were surprised that \"First Hill\" was not called \"Cliff Side.\" It is downhill to everything and parts of that hill are very steep.  It is one mile to the waterfront, most of which is a hill. We walked everywhere and the end of the day was always uphill. So be aware of that. If you rent a car, parking is available on the street, but not always easy to find. There are time limits and fees for street parking. The building is located beside several hospitals. There are emergency vehicle sirens all the time. And there are the normal city noises: traffic, voices, etc. Justin\\'s windows block most of it, but if you like to have the windows open, it can be distracting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is great: mostly residential in the immediate area, but within 1/2 - 1 mile to everything Seattle has to offer: coffee shops, great restaurants, shopping. Capital Hill has it all, even a pot shop. Capital Hill is very LGBT friendly, so if that bothers you, stay away. But there is no in-your-face gayness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI give this apartment a very positive review. And affordable by Seattle standards.',\n",
       " \"Justin's place was awesome! It's in a wonderful location in Capitol Hill area full of great bars and restaurants. If you're looking for an LGBT friendly area, this is it! You're also a 15 min walk from downtown and it's super convenient to get to the Washington State Convention Center it's an easy walk away. \\r\\n\\r\\nJustin was very communicate and gave simple directions to enter his place without him being present. It couldn't have been easier. He was very courteous and a quick communicator. \\r\\n\\r\\nJustin's condo was in impeccable shape. Very clean, organized and nicely decorated. You can't miss the 100 inch projector which made for some epic nights of relaxation and Netflix vegging. In short, the place really felt like home and the complimentary water, fruit, and bagels was a nice touch. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will definitely be staying here again when I make it to Seattle again!

       " \"Great room and a great host. We only saw Jessica the day we got there as she's pretty busy, but we did get to hang out with her for cats which were all sweet and friendly. The neighborhood was great, and it was close to Seattle Centre, which was what we needed.\\r\\nRoom and house were clean and having the outside deck set was nice. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. Unfortunately we didn't make use off the sauna, so I can't comment.\",\n",
       " 'Room was good, super easy access! Had no dramas... The sauna was nice. Cool little place to stay : )',\n",
       " \"Great clean room, super quiet. Plenty of privacy for a good price. You have to walk outside on the deck to access the bathroom in the main house area, but this wasn't a problem for us. Very close to a cute retail area with lots of good restaurants! \",\n",
       " \"Jessica's place is great! The space is very comfortable. There's an outside area to sit and have coffee or hang out. It's separate from the main house, so you have access to the kitchen and bathroom through a side door right next to the Zen Den. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe location is awesome - just a quick walk to the water or to The Junction (this area of town). Great restaurants and funky boutiques. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had our dog with us this trip and found both her house and the neighborhood very dog friendly. Lots of places to walk your dog. It's a 15 minute drive to one of the best dog parks I've been to (Westcrest).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were visiting friends and family closer into downtown Seattle and the drive was quick and easy every time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downside was worrying about walking into her house to use the bathroom or grab some water in the middle of the night - which is pretty typical for me in general....\\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn't see her much, but whenever we ran into her, she was very welcoming. I totally recommend her space!\",\n",
       " 'The Zen Den is a peaceful and secluded room in the back of the house - the trees helped keep the room cool in the summer heat. Really enjoyed our stay. ',\n",
       " 'Very good organisation for my stay at Zen Den. We could not meet with Jessica because we were on the road, but I had a very nice night in this very quiet and Zen place. Thank you Jessica',\n",
       " 'First let me say this is a great neighborhood! Really fun and everything is walking distance. Alki Beach and Schmitz park are a quick busride away. If you like staying away from tourist trap areas, then this is the place for you. Host was nice and welcoming, gave us fresh towels and everything. We were four, and although it was a bit tight, it was comfortable for crashing out for the night. ',\n",
       " 'The host made feel at home and welcomed. She has an open personality.',\n",
       " 'The room was nice and clean and the area was very quiet at night. Jessica welcomed us when we arrived but did not see him afterwards as she was working nights. Nice place and according to description!',\n",
       " 'The Zen Den was perfect for my stay.  A quiet residential street near friends.  Just a few blocks from West Seattles main street California Ave.  The bed and space is perfect for one person but 2 could easily manage. Easy access to kitchen and bath from deck near the rooms private entrance.  The cats were sweet, friendly and very respectful.  \\r\\nJessica was there to welcome me. Checked in mid week when our paths crossed. And was so sweet and thoughtful with gift of a vegan cupcake on my last evening.  Thank you Jessica.',\n",
       " 'We stayed at the Zen Den for four nights and really enjoyed our stay. The location is ideal for anyone wanting a more quiet Seattle experience. Just a few minutes to Alki Beach and all the bars and shops of West Seattle. The room itself was immaculate and cozy. We never met Jessica during our stay but she was very communicative and thoughtful. Bathroom is shared and in the main house, this may not be ideal for everyone but it worked fine for us and was very clean. Overall I think this is a great airbnb and would love to stay again next time we are in Seattle.',\n",
       " \"I arrived to a lovely welcome card, a bottle of water and basket of necessities, and a pristine room that looked just as delightful as pictured. The neighborhood was great, lots of excellent restaurants less than a mile away, and I had the chance to just unwind and rest as I needed to. The sauna was fantastic, and Jess couldn't have been more helpful. Will definitely go again if I find myself needing a place in West Seattle.\",\n",
       " \"Jessica left us a cute little greeting card which includes the information for the WiFi network. She also provided the basic necessities such as towels and various items such as little soaps and shampoos. There is WiFi, so that's a plus. Just a note, there were two cats that I encountered during my stay. Overall, it was a neat Zen-themed room. \",\n",
       " \"Jessica welcomed me in person to give me the lay of the land. There was  a handwritten note on the table, and bottle of water for me as well as a little bowl and bottle of water for my dog. Really nice touch. Jessica was great at texting me with updates and checking in (e.g., I could come over early if wanted, where it might be slippery during a rain, etc.). I appreciated that. I didn't see her much after the first intro, but I felt like she was already ready and available.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought the room was great and would absolutely stay again. In fact, I think the Seattle PI paper just featured it as a cool place for a potential local staycation. The room is, as noted, a separate place with its own entrance at the back of the house. Very private and quiet. Inside, the warm-colored hardwood and sunset colors make it really warm. The bed was incredibly comfortable, which makes napping very tempting. And I did use the FAR sauna one night, which is a nice bonus. My dog was also with me, and it was simple and easy. As other reviewers note, the bathroom and kitchen are in the main house. It's a 10 ft walk down the deck to the door. I was a little worried coming in the house at night the first time, but Jessica assured me it was expected. I never saw anyone when I went in day or night, and it quickly became routine. If you do want water in the room at night/in general, you could grab a gallon at the local grocery store fora buck like I did.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for location, West Seattle is great. The main street is a short walk away, with lots of great places for food, shopping. Huge fan of Husky Deli. Great dog park 15 min away, or head down to the walkway along the sound close by or 10 min up by Alki Beach. Great views and people watching. And if you walk around the neighborhood, you can see the Sound a few blocks away. If you want to head into downtown Seattle, you're a 15 min drive away.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wholeheartedly recommend Jessica and the Zen Den.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",
       " \"The room was very clean. The neighborhood was nice and was in a convenient location. The only drawback was having to go outside to get into the main house to use the bathroom, but that definitely isn't a deal-breaker. We never saw Jess during our stay, but she kept in constant contact to give us advice on where to go/answer any other questions. We would, and probably will, stay here again.\",\n",

However, we communicated by email and she was absolutely as welcome, friendly and informative as can be.  I felt very comfortable setting out to her place despite the fact that it's only my second airbnb experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood is so very sweet, with lovely historic homes, as is hers. Short walk to a cluster of restaurants and bars (around California and Alaska intersection).  Extremely pleasurable setting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room is GORGEOUS, warm and restful -- the bed and linens so soft and comfortable. The kitties hanging outside are approachable and friendly if you're interested in interacting. The bathroom/kitchen are only a few steps away, extremely easy access.  All orderly and easy to find what you need. \\r\\n\\r\\nI LOVED staying at Jessica's.  She has an obviously strongly individualistic creative/aesthetic sense which makes the space of the room, the area outside, and I imagine the other spaces as well, wonderfully filled with enlivening, interesting, thought-provoking, beautiful images. Recommended with absolutely no reservations!\",\n",

Jessica went above and beyond in providing some amenities, such as toiletries, bottled water, slippers and housecoats. There was free and easy access to the washroom and kitchen. I would have loved to meet Jessica, but didn't have the opportunity. Instead, I got to enjoy her charming cats :) (my choice). The place is located in a very cool neighbourhood, just a 15 min drive from downtown. There are great shops, restaurants and grocery stores around. Great value for money- I would stay again. \",\n",

You can walk to the Junction, with great shops, restaurants and yoga and public transportation.

I actually did not see her the entire time of my stay but I did meet her roommate Dale briefly. It is a little bothersome to have to go outside from the zen den into the main house to use the bathroom, but it was as advertised. Overall I've of the nicest airbnb experiences I have had so far.\",\n",

The bathroom is inside the main house and just several steps outside of the door to the room. We did not get to meet Jessica during our stay, but she made us feel welcome with a box of Valentine's chocolates and a list of fun things to do in the area. We could not get our Wi-Fi to connect but overall we had a really positive experience! Would stay here again.\",\n",

I felt  never felt so comfortable in some one else's house!\\r\\n\\r\\n The Zen Den is clean, comfortable and most of all relaxing.  I love the fact that the sauna has a MP3 adapter cord that allows for you to play music from almost any device.

Jessica was extremely accommodating and had laid out waters, robes and any necessities that one might require.  We only met her one time and it didn't feel like either party intruded on the other whatsoever.  The description is very accurate the room, kitchen and bathroom were kept spotless.  The bed was a memory foam and extremely comfortable.  Easy and plentiful parking.  The only slight downside is having to go outside, on the deck which is fairly private, a few steps to the glass doors leading to the kitchen and bathroom.  We would definitely stay there again.      \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

Right down the street from a nice strip of stores and food. We had breakfast at easy street cafe which was great and about a 10 minute walk from the house. When we arrived the room was very clean and smelt nice! The bathroom and kitchen were accessible and also clean! There are cats in the house and outside which were all very friendly! I would definitely stay here again. I don't think the location and price can be beat. \",\n",

The neighborhood was extremely quiet with beautiful houses surrounding the area and a somewhat short walk towards a few parks near the coast as well as walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  Keep in mind it is a private room but you have to walk a few steps to the main house for the restroom and kitchen!  I would recommend the zen den to my friends in a heartbeat.',\n",

At first we were a little leery with the shared bathroom/kitchen but became comfortable quickly due to the inviting atmosphere. We loved the cats and there was usually one wanting in or out.  There’s lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance and we had breakfast at the Easy Street Café. A quick bus ride downtown was also only steps away.

The room is a little smaller than it appears in the photo, but it's still sizable and the bed is actually bigger than it appears, and a good bed is really all anyone needs! Her laundry machine was broken, which isn't a big deal in of itself, but considering we were coming to the close of a 3 week road trip and she knew of our situation, it would have been nice to know of this ahead of time since it was inevitable we'd want to use it.

She messaged me early in the day giving me detailed instructions on what to do and where to go. It was great. She told me I could message her whenever if there were any problems, but We never needed to. We had plans to go explore downtown soon after arrival but as soon as we opened the door we were kind of grounded! The whole place had a very soothing ambiance. There was incense, meditation books, A SAUNA..all in our delightful place. Namaste was everything we needed and that's exactly what we got. There is no bathroom attached so you do have to go into her part of the house, BUT she always made it available for you to do so at any time. The bus system is EXCELLENT. We didn't even need to rent a car. It's About a five minute walk to a bus stop, Starbucks, shops, restaurants and bars. We took the bus into downtown in the middle of rush hour, but it still only took us 20 minutes AND the best part is it runs ALL night. Totally worth not staying in the heart of downtown. In fact, it was MUCH better.  Her cats are super sweet and cuddly and it was nice to be greeted by their sweet meows and loves every time we came home. Jessica has a sweet set up here, I'd suggest it to anybody that enjoys some calmness to their vacations. \",\n",

       " \"Jessica's home is a wonderful stay. Her bed is AMAZING. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed in. The room is nice because it's separated from the house making it very private -- you don't feel like you are in Jessica's space at all. There's also plenty of street parking in her area. For first time Seattle visitors make sure you do your research because she is in WEST Seattle, meaning it will be a bit of a trek to get to the city at times. That being said there's plenty to do in the junction downtown (I recommend easy street records for brunch) and you can take the c line into town easily. She is super friendly and a Great host! \",\n",

The walls are burgundy not orange as they appear in the photos. Because we stayed for a full week, we got to meet Jessica and see her several times and she is so sweet. We had full access to the kitchen dining and bathroom. Coffee every morning and a computer on the table so I could check my email and watch a show on Hulu. I felt right at home.',\n",

       " \"As a few of the other reviews mentioned, I didn't get to meet Jess, but wish I would have. Did meet her boyfriend and he was quite helpful upon arrival. Couldn't have asked for a better little spot and location during my visit to Seattle. The bathroom not being connected to the space (as mentioned in the description) is not as big of deal as it may seem. A little bit of an older house inside, but it fits the neighborhood and vibe perfectly. The house is a 5-8 minute walk to some neat coffee shops, restaurants and convenient stores. Easy Street Records is a must visit for breakfast. PHENOMENAL. I highly recommend Jessica's place (if you could not already tell). The sauna worked wonders each morning, the bed was super comfortable, and the house is perfectly located for all things Seattle. \",\n",

We flew into Seattle late, and she was very gracious about it. She was a very friendly, warm and helpful individual. The pull out couch was memory foam and seemed comfortable. The shower was a bit small, but not an issue for me. The basement unit is in a great location - a little ways away from the Space Needle, but had tons of things to do in the area (and not an issue if you have a car or one of those ride share apps). Ample amount of parking on the street. Felt like the area was very safe. ',\n",

The room was quiet and the neighborhood was very walkable to be able to get food and other vitals. Very safe. The breakfast option was great with a variety of delicious options available, including good coffee, juice, and tea. Guests should be aware that breakfast is self serve, in case there is any confusion (I was not confused). Overall a very excellent and easy experience for a budget traveler. \",\n",

Thanks Leslie for everything, hope to be back again! \",\n",

The neighborhood is quiet (other than some ambulance noises because you're near a hospital) and there are several great restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance.

Huge bathroom, skylight, peaceful, quiet. She's done a perfect renovation leaving no stone unturned in my opinion.  The tree-lined neighborhood is quiet, convenient to all of Seattle, close to bike trails, shopping, and also easy access to Bellevue/Kirkland.  Parking was easy and the whole experience was awesome.  I only wish I had had more time here.

I used the AppleTV a lot, which was fun. It was very clean, and although the kitchen was small, it had everything I needed. There were lots of cute touches, like the basket of clementine’s in the reading room. I love it! The only thing I should let people know, and I know lots of people have already said this in their reviews and Jennifer reminds you when you get there, is that you have to be careful to not hit your head when you enter and leave. Same thing goes in the reading room. Just watch what you’re doing, and you’ll be fine! I would give this place 6 stars if I could. I had such a wonderful stay.',\n",

Practically right in front of the beautiful Lincoln Park and a stones throw away from the bus stop and ferries. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was hard to say good-bye but now we now know exactly where to send friends and family anytime they're in the area. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you so much for everything!\",\n",

It's just like the pictures, if not better. The neighborhood is very safe and right across from the park. It was so nice to be able to walk down to the beach and enjoy the view. This specific room that we stayed in was in the back of the house and very quiet. There was demolition/construction going on across the street, and I didn't even hear it until I went downstairs.

An additional bonus is that Alki Beach is just a short hop away, so if you are visiting Seattle during the summer time, this location is one of the best. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall 20 out of 10 with large rooms, Downy soft / clean towels, an amazingly soft bed that you don't want to leave and fantastic amenities; perfect in every way!\",\n",

Carla greeted us warmly, and all the amenities were attractive, spotless, and of high quality. We had a delightful chat with another couple that was also staying there, and we all enjoyed quite a substantial breakfast (yoghurt, eggs, coffee, tea, cereals, even a loaf of zucchini bread which Carla had baked for us -- delicious!).

He even let us use the washer/dryer which was an added benefit! The neighborhood was cozy, and being a 10min walk from the water was awesome. Be sure to check out sunset at the nearby Lincoln Park! By bus, the house was 30min from downtown and about 50min from the airport. I will definitely stay here again if I'm able to make another visit to Seattle!\",\n",

Mit dem Bus kommt man gut in die Stadt, das Haus ist ruhig gelegen, so dass man gut schlafen kann.\\r\\nEs wird sogar ein kleines Frühstück mit Kaffee oder Tee geboten, was man sich selbst zurecht machen kann.

The house was clean, beautiful, & not even 5 minutes walk to / from the nearest bus stop. As first-time travelers to Seattle, & arriving late via Bolt bus from Portland, we were tired, disoriented, & a little cranky. But Sean & Karla were great about hopping on the phone to make sure we made it to their place OK from downtown (excellent response time / communication); Sean was very welcoming upon arrival; & they had Q-tips in the bathroom!

The home is beautiful and located in a very nice area.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon our arrival, we noticed the front door was open. I called Sean and within seconds he walked out to greet us. \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon entering the home, I was even further impressed with the cleanliness. We were given a tour of the home and a key for re-entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur room was setup like a hotel room, only better. The bed was made very neatly, water bottles along with chocolates were on the table, and fresh folded towels laid at the foot of the bed. The bathroom was just as clean. \\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the street is Lincoln Park--a beautiful park which opens up to the Puget Sound. A plus if you\\'re wanting to enjoy yourself outdoors. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed we slept on was EXTREMELY comfortable and clean. The sheets were very soft and it had us not wanting to get out of bed. Oh, and the sheets and towels smelled wonderful. We truly felt pampered. \\r\\n\\r\\nLocation wise, I don\\'t feel you could get any better. The home is 15 minutes from everything. So, if you\\'re wanting a good \"HQ\" to venture out into the city, this is ideal. \\r\\n\\r\\nEach morning we had breakfast and coffee awaiting us. We had toast and yogurt. Nothing too extensive, but it\\'s just perfect to get you started. You will also have full access to the kitchen and really every part of the home. We felt as if we lived there. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts were very social and their son is the smartest 4.5 year old we\\'ve ever met. They were both extremely knowledgable about Seattle, too. They had so many recommendations for us as we ventured out into the city. Much better than any concierge service at a hotel. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would HIGHLY recommend that if you\\'re looking to stay in Seattle, book with them. 5 stars all around. \\r\\n\\r\\nSean, Karla, and Seamus, thank you all for opening up your home and making us feel comfortable during our stay. You all are great people. Should we move to Seattle, we\\'ll definitely keep in touch. Cheers. ',\n",

I normally strongly prefer self-contained private lodgings, but this was an exception to the rule. I felt completely at ease here and with them, and slept very well in their roomy, quiet guest room. The shared bathroom is immaculate and roomy. Everything is thoughtfully appointed, clean and current, with absolutely nothing fusty nor musty. Parking was directly in front of the house -- easy! \\r\\n\\r\\nI had contacted them ahead of time about whether my dog would be welcome, and they said he would. It turned out to be a great visit for the dog, too! A large park is a few steps away -- great for on-dog walking. \\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the neighborhood is very residential, and at least a half hour by car or public bus from downtown Seattle during traffic hours. But as noted above, I would stay here again in a heartbeat. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat really makes this a great lodging choice in the Seattle area are the hosts. Super friendly and easy-going. Lovely family! If you're going to stay in another person's home when travelling, this is the best kind of experience to have. Excellent!\",\n",

They had the bedroom beautifully decorated with all the amenities I needed; a cozy, warm bed, desk, comfy chair, and plenty of room for my clothing and belongings.  Chocolate, water and a snack were also awaiting me in the room. The bathroom was equally as lovely with space for my things, shampoo and conditioner and hair dryer.

They were extremely generous with sharing their space in the refrigerator, and the coffee in the morning was delicious.  ',\n",

We had several days vacation in Vancouver prior to arriving to Seattle and Sean was gracious to let us do a load of laundry there and also accommodated our late arrival due to our tight schedule and trying to see and experience as much as Seattle as possible.

Sean encouraged us to put my ice ags into his freezer so they were good and  cold when I needed them to be. neighborhood is well established with many older homes.

Their home is in a the Seawrd Park area that is just blocks from Lake Washington and within a mile of Columbia City shops, bars with live entertainment and delicious little restaurants (highly recommend Columbia City Bakery for coffee and baked goods!). The light rail station is a short walk away and is only a 20 minute ride to downtown Seattle and very easy to figure out. There are a lot of inclines to consider if you plan on walking or biking, but for the average person, I would say you can easily get by without a car rental if you\\'re okay with a bit of walking. We felt safe even walking home at 2 AM. There is so much beautiful flora around, our walks to and from Shari & Michael\\'s house took longer as we found ourselves admiring all of the neighborhood gardens!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house and room was open, very well kept and bright just as described. They had a newly updated bathroom for us to use and they opened their kitchen for us to use as well. We had a chance to have breakfast, coffee and awesome conversation with them on our last morning as well. They have lived and raised a family in this home so they had a lot of insight on good places to walk to and sights to see that were a bit off the \"normal tourist path\". Michael is an avid bicyclist, so he can offer great suggestions for those who might want to bike around. Highly recommended to take a few moments to hang out in their backyard as well! They have a beautiful outdoor space to have breakfast, drink a late night glass of wine via candlelight and enjoy it all without the hassle of any biting bugs!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo honored to be their first Air BnB guests and can bet they will have many happy guests to come! If you are in this part of Seattle, Shari and Michael\\'s place would be a peaceful and safe place for a single person or a couple to rest their head at night :)',\n",

You'll feel right at home when you walk in the open door. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is a short walk to Seward Park, a great place to relax and unwind. You can go swimming in Lake Washington or ride your bike/run around the path and trails. Really peaceful with nice views of the Seattle skyline off in the distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're in the area you're probably wanting to explore a lot of Seattle. This place is a great location to make base camp for exploration. We had our car, so I can't comment on public transportation. But it only took on average 15 minutes to get to downtown from the house with our car. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou won't regret staying here. Can't wait to see Shari and Michael again! \",\n",

The bed was firm and comfortable, the view and sunshine (I forgot to close the blinds before bed, I highly recommend that if you don't want to be up with the sun) brilliant, and the bathroom-I could live in that shower. Awesome hot water and pressure plus lots of space and sparkling clean. Parking was easy.  I didn't go into the city while I stayed with Shari but the lake is a cpl blocks away and lovely. Come stay with Shari and Michael! They're wonderful!\",\n",

My friend and I were in Seattle for several days to attend a convention, and we greatly appreciated that they accommodated us returning home late.

Michael shared his experiences and advice regarding travel around Washington, which made my trip home much more interesting than it would have been. The location was also great.

The house is right near Lake Washington which is just gorgeous. There is so much to do right in that area that we could've stayed in Seward Park the entire time.

My only concerns are that if you're wanting to enjoy the patio furniture- ask her about where the cushions are beforehand, because we didn't cross paths much and the chairs had no cushions and weren't practical to spend time on (which I was stoked for). I also had problems connecting to the internet and there was no shampoo/conditioner provided, but if you ask her about these things asap I'm sure she'll take care of them.\",\n",

The main bedroom has a queen bed, and there is a twin bed in a small room off the hallway. Both were very comfortable. Tom had to work late on the day we arrived, but he provided detailed instructions in advance, and we had no trouble reaching him when we had a question.

Tom was always available via cell phone with any questions or concerns we had, and was around the house (he lives on the bottom floor) in the evening. The bathroom was absolutely gorgeous and accommodated 3 girls perfectly (so many towels!). He even provided some snacks. The bed was comfortable, and the whole suite was very clean. The 2nd room with the two stacked mattresses was smaller than I thought, but it wasn't a problem for us. The neighborhood itself was very pleasant. We would sit in the backyard and I very much enjoyed listening to the marching band from the high school across the street practice. There were breakfast places, convenience stores, and pubs nearby as well, all in walking distance. Parking was easy and free - right across the street. The other individuals who live on the main floor were also so kind and helpful and didn't seem bothered by our questions or small talk.

It is across the street from a high school, but we had no issues with that at all. Parking is conveniently located across the street.

Our week was activity-packed with many scheduled events to attend and had family members scattered around Ravenna, so we weren't around much to spend quiet times at the suite. On the check-in day, we went straight to a museum after picking up my sister from the airport and then headed to a dinner gathering from the museum. So we checked-in late, I'd say ~ 11 pm.  Though we had the entry code, Tom stayed up to greet us at the door and to show us around. The place is cute, as you see in the photos; a packed linen closet and bathroom full of accessories.    BTW, there's a local fruit/vegetable stand at the corner intersection and a Whole Foods Market a few blocks down which came in very handy for quick breakfast needs.  His place is ornate; reminded me of New England homes with character! I'd recommend this suite to anyone, especially with a 'little munchkin' (who can sleep inside the small Nintendo room).  \",\n",

We would stay with Tom again without even thinking!',\n",
       " \"Photos and description of this property were completely accurate and did not disappoint.  We spent four nights there for three adults.  The small extra bed is tucked away in a small area to the side of the stairs, private and under the roof, not for the claustrophobic, but very comfortable and with it's own TV.  Master bed is a comfortable queen in a pretty room with nice bedding, furnishings, coved ceilings, great dimming lights, nice wood finishes and louvers over the window.  The entire suite is well equipped and just as nice or better than the photos.  Plenty of privacy upstairs with it's own access and locked door.  Tom has other tenants who live on site who are polite and accommodating and willing to answer questions.  Tom went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and even left chocolate, coffee, chilled water, china, glassware and flatware.  The small refrigerator and microwave worked well and the coffee maker was well stocked and nice to have in the room.  Our stay was warm, up to 90 degrees during the day which is very unusual for Seattle.  Tom provided fans and a spot air conditioner to help make us comfortable.  I was concerned about parking being offsite, but it was absolutely convenient and just a very short walk across the street, next to the High School with shade trees and is on a very quiet side street.  No problem at all - it was the only part of the city where we didn't have to search or fight for parking.  We didn't really use the common area on the main floor, but it was available and convenient if we had needed it.  The tenants were quiet and polite and didn't disturb us at all.  The back yard is shady in the afternoon and close by if you need it.  Freeway access to Capital Hill, Downtown, Space Needle and the University of Washington is convenient and easy to negotiate on Interstate 5.  SeaTac is farther, but still convenient and I would prefer this location to the airport since it puts you closer to most of the nice attractions in Seattle and some great neighborhoods and restaurants.  The neighborhood is quiet and was safe and easy to access.  I would absolutely stay here again and would highly recommend Tom as a host who goes the extra mile to ensure the guests are comfortable.  We had extra towels we didn't use, plenty of dishes, paper supplies, reading material and area guides.  There's a Safeway grocery store very nearby for any food you need and several restaurants.  We took a side trip to Gig Harbor and Bremerton and came back into Seattle on the Ferry about 5:30 pm which gave us fantastic views of Seattle and the Sound.  Highly recommend it if you have an afternoon and don't mind the drive up I-5 through Tacoma.  Thanks Tom.  We loved staying in your home.  Love the attention to details and your taste in décor.\",\n",
       " 'On day 1, due to our flight schedule, we did not reach until 1:30AM. Tom greeted us and helped us get settled. If our travels take us to Seattle, we certainly will stay at his place. Tom is a gracious host and has made his unit everything a guest would need and want. ',\n",

The AC would not have been an issue but we were in Seattle during the heat wave of the century. \\n\\nAll in all, I highly recommend the Sweet Suite. I hope to stay there again if I come back to Seattle. And Tom was a very generous, kind host.\",\n",

The neighborhood is not ideal....lots of boarded up homes in the next block and nearby and the traffic on 15th can be loud. Three things might have helped: 1. if the back patio was cleaned up and more inviting (as in the photo) 2. if the air conditioner worked. Tom said he was going to resolve this when we left because he recognized it can be an issue. We were very uncomfortable because the whole floor was sweltering despite fans. We did not ask for one but it would have been nice to be offered a bit of a refund from the higher weekend rates and fees we paid. 3. if there were different sorts of snacks available. We didn't eat or use any of the offerings. Top Ramen and the like. Would have been nice to have a healthier choice. Again, Tom seems like a really good guy and it may be a great place for someone else. For us, we would not go back.\",\n",
       " \"The room was as described and we had a very comfortable stay with a second room that would be perfect for 1-2 kids if a family were guests and a little privacy is desired.  Both my daughter and I slept well.   The bathtub and steam shower was deliciously relaxing.   I recommend Tom's space.  He was gracious, informative and very prompt with communication.   \",\n",

       " 'Tom responded to all my questions before our visit, and the room had everything anyone could possibly need (I particularly appreciated the filtered water).  It was very hot during our stay in Seattle, but Tom had thoughtfully installed an airconditioner before we arrived!  \\r\\n\\r\\nI had thought that parking might be a challenge, reading the listing, but the parking location behind the school is actually just across the street and we never had a problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for accommodating us during a fun weekend in Seattle!',\n",
       " \"Nice and large room with all the facilties you may need and more. The only think we strongly suggest to improve is the air conditioning. Unfortunately we never met the owner but we were in touch with him via email. The neighbourhood is not much populated with many houses permanently closed in the area although it seemed quite safe and there's one grocery near the house. If you wish to go downtown expect 30min by bus. \",\n",

       " 'Tom\\'s place was a great fit for our family. We were just returning to the states after living abroad and needed something close to family, in walking distance of shops/restaurants, and big enough for our family of four. The extra \"bedroom\" was perfect for our four year old who enjoyed having his own space. The large bath & shower were lovely after our long travels. Bed was very comfortable, and there were plenty of linens and extras on hand. Tom was very welcoming and stocked the room for every need. We would definitely recommend staying here. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur only \"concern\" was keeping our 1.5 year old from the staircase. The stairs leading to the second floor are very steep (as is the norm for all homes in the area), and the opening to the stairwell is next to the bed. I would not expect the host to do anything about this! Just a thing to note for families that may have a little one along.\\r\\n',\n",

       " 'Tom was a great & friendly host, welcoming us as we arrived late.  The suite was just as pictured & described, with a lovely room and very beautiful bathroom, which was the best feature, in my opinion.  The neighborhood is in a good part of northern Seattle but it is located on a busy thoroughfare so be prepared for some street noise.  All in all, a very good place to stay and well priced.',\n",

We were welcomed with a keurig coffee maker and a beautiful bathtub and shower set up that was so amazing.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn't have a lot of time to spend over there as there were things we wanted to experience.  But overall, it was an awesome time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was a great experience for my first time using Airbnb.\",\n",

We only got around to using the steam-room shower at the end (the shower was great, but we hadn't used the steam feature). It was like living in a spa hotel, but more like being at home at the same time. Everything was perfect and Tom and housemates made us feel welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area is nice for getting out for a walk. Green Lake and many shops are walking distance and even the university is only about 30 minutes by foot (and has a good bus connection).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe'd gladly come again and certainly look forward to it sometime in the future.\",\n",

He was very hospitable and helped us get our luggage in after showing us around the space. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe suite was very comfortable and clean. Tom has thought of pretty much all of the little details to make sure that people have everything they need. Light switches are labeled, information about the house is readily available on a sheet that Tom has printed out, there are brochures for things to do in Madison, coffee and snacks are provided, and the bathroom is full of any toiletry you can imagine. The steam shower and soaking tub are fantastic and help to create the impression that you are staying in your own personal spa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location was exactly as the listing described and the neighborhood was very convenient to the UW area, which was the purpose of my trip. It was also just a short trip to get to Downtown to check out the Pike Place Market and we were able to easily visit with friends in the Capitol Hill, Fremont, and Green Lake neighborhoods.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough we didn't get to spend a lot of time with Tom due to our busy schedule, our brief interactions were very pleasant and he was helpful in offering suggestions for attractions and food nearby. \",\n",
       " \"Even before I arrived, Tom helped me feel welcome by responding quickly to all my emailed questions and requests.  Knowing that I was arriving before the official check-in time, he encouraged me to head to the house straight from the airport and relax in the common area until the Suite was ready - when I arrived, the Suite was ready for me early (clean and well-stocked with toiletries, maps/tourist information, snacks, and extra linens/blankets), which was a wonderful welcome after a long trip from the East coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Suite (especially the amazing bathroom) surpassed my expectations based on the listing, and the neighborhood was convenient for public transportation, walking to restaurants, shopping for groceries, and access to local parks.  Walking alone at night, I felt quite safe there.  Having access to the basement washer & dryer, was also a huge plus.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTom was extremely hospitable whenever our paths crossed during the 4 days/nights I was there, and encouraged me to make myself at home in his house, which was easy to do.  I was staying in Seattle in advance of my goddaughter's wedding outside the city, which was the following weekend at Cama Beach State Park.  With regard to our various wedding preparations, Tom was extremely generous and flexible:  my goddaughter's younger sister ended up staying with me in the Suite and Tom graciously welcomed her; and he allowed us to pack his basement refrigerator with lots of groceries we bought for the wedding weekend.  Over and above his role as Airbnb host, he was a huge help in our wedding preparations.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would happily stay there again if I were in need of lodging in Seattle.  \",\n",
       " \"Tom's hospitality was amazing.  The suite was larger than expected and is very nicely updated with a great feeling.   Includes many thoughtful extras and details that were appreciated.  Would for sure stay here again given the chance. Highly recommended for a cozy indoor stay.\",\n",

       " \"Tom's place is an amazing gem that I will definitely consider should I come by Seattle again. The suite was huge with plenty of space for my family of 4. There were lots of nice little touches that made the stay very welcoming. It really felt like a home away from home. Tom himself was prompt in all communication and answered all my queries. It was a wonderful experience for us!\\r\\n\",\n",

       " \"The Huey House was fantastic from booking to our departure.  It's in the coolest neighborhood and the location was perfect for a family weekend.  This is very much a family home, not a professional rental.  The Huey Family was super accomodating and straightforward.  When we arrived there was a basket with beer and juices for the kids and they were cool enough to have toys for the kids laid out and soap/shampoo in the bathrooms. There was plenty of everything and we felt welcome in their home.    We are grateful.\",\n",

On our 3rd and 4th day,the weather turned pretty stormy and they emailed us  from out of the country to make sure we were ok and  wanted to know if we needed anything.

Driving north on Highway 99 can get you downtown in less than 30 minutes. You don't even need to go downtown -- West Seattle has some great places of its own to eat and explore. Jennifer's home is located on a nice quiet street. She is a meticulous and hardworking gardener so the exterior of her home is well tended and filled with a nice variety of flowers and plants. Inside the home -- it really is cozy! The room is comfortable and has been tastefully decorated and furnished. I loved the hi-speed internet connection! I didn't use it, but there is also a nice flat screen TV. The bed is quite comfy, the water in the shower is nice and hot.

After a month we both found jobs, and a new home right here in West Seattle. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Jennifer and her home is both cozy and inviting.

So we searched for a place in West Seattle that wasn't as expensive as a hotel. Jennifer's seemed like a good bet, and indeed it was perfect for us. We got in late and left early each day, and that wasn't a problem for her at all. We did cross paths a couple times, and she seems like someone you'd like to hang with. The bathroom might could use an upgrade, but it was very clean as was everything. Very buttoned down. We'd certainly stay there again.\",\n",

However, upon Jenny opening the door, I was warmly greeted and all my fears quickly went by the way side. What started out as a nice place to stay led to us become fast friends and enjoying each others company. Jenny is a woman on the go so those who chose to stay with her (why wouldn't you) just know that for the most part there will be ample time for some alone time and to have the space to yourself. The house is warm and inviting and having a car was most helpful. The bed.....ahhh the bed, was incredibly comfortable and the only thing I can compare it to is the W's heavenly bed. While I am not forgoing hotels completely, this was a great experience and is an especially good service for those on extended stays. Jenny was a superb host, the room was again, warm and inviting completely stocked with coffee, tea, and assorted oatmeals. If able, make the trek down to her coffee shop and be spoiled by her Americanos!!! Next time I am in Seattle on an extended stay, I will be sure to stay with Jen!!! \",\n",

She was very understanding and welcoming, offering to run to the store if I needed something. The house was very comfortable, quiet, relaxing and pleasant, as was the neighborhood. The bed and bedding were extremely comfortable. I appreciated having kitchen privileges and being able to watch DVDs in the guest room and on the large TV screen in the living room.

The room was beautifully decorated and the blinds were great for blocking sunlight as I worked nights. The bed was very large and comfy cozy. The house and room were very clean and organized. There was ample closet and storage space. The location was about a 15 minute drive from downtown Seattle/Pikes Place which worked out great! Avoided the crazy city traffic but wasn't too far to visit. The highway was also a five minute drive away and there was a bus line a block away. The yard was adorable with beautiful trees and flowers everywhere. Jennifer has quite a green thumb. She had tomato plants that she grew in her backyard and shared the tomatoes with me. They were so delicious and fresh. Jennifer is also an amazing cook and baker! Oh My God does this woman know how to bake! She was always in the kitchen whipping something scrumptious up and sharing it with me. What a treat that was :) Jennifer herself is a very friendly, high energy, lovely lady. She was forever in a good mood and always eager to help. I cant thank her enough for allowing me to stay in her house with her.

The king bed was very comfortable, not too firm but not soft. The water pressure was good in the shower. If you have a car, rent a parking space!!! No on-street parking to be seen.  The area is steeply hilly, so if you have mobility issues, this could be a big challenge, as could the 2 flights of stairs to the unit. We felt safe in the neighborhood. The portable air conditioners in the living room and bedroom were much appreciated, as it was hot hot hot when we were there.

First night, hearing people outside my window, I thought that would be a problem, but it seems that the neighbors share a common bedtime. I slept peacefully. Sharing the bathrooms felt like I had my own, as they were always clean and available. The only houseguest who was noisy was me...as one mid-morning I was downstairs singing karaoke and dancing with Jasmine...(so much fun). Some evenings upon my return, I would sit and chat with J & J. They are really good people. Being steps away from the bus and light rail was perfect.

There was a  record player and small vinyl collection (we got a lot of mileage out of the Footloose soundtrack, most notably an epic recreation of the \"Kevin Bacon Angry Dance\" after we were both eliminated from the tournament). A beautifully pre-set table made for a nice dinner for two, and there are dozens of great bars up and down the street. For our inevitable recovery day, the flat was isolated from street noise, and well stocked with interesting books and magazines. That combined with a great bed, Netflix, and a shower stall that\\'s perfect for one to slump on the floor of letting the hangover wash off - we had it made. We\\'ll be recommending it to everyone who visits, and certainly be vacationing in Belltown again soon!',\n",

       " \"Great location! Easy to walk all around the central market and waterfront, up to Paramount Theatre, main shopping streets, lots of restaurants. The entrance to the apartment is clean and safe. FUNKY stairs and landing especially since both the apartment door and the cocktail lounge door are side by side. I enjoyed the music and chatter coming from the lounge - friendly and unique - never heard a rowdy moment and didn't keep me awake (ear plugs are provided but I didn't use any). The apartment is very cozy, nicely laid out, and clean. Dishes are well stocked and Cory/Amanda left us orange juice, fresh milk, tea/coffee and ginger beer. Bathroom is small and functional (the shower head could be stronger). Great heat supply (and we were in a cold snap!) and if it's too hot, the radiator valve can be adjusted. Bed and pull out couch are very comfortable with good sheets.  Enjoyed the record player, flat screen TV with Netflicks, fun art, and high ceilings. Some natural light, no view but dark and very little traffic noise at night.   Definitely would return!\",\n",

Even though I was next door to a lounge bar, I was never bothered and the noise level was never outrageous. I slept without earplugs. Amanda and Cory are a simple text or call away for anything. I will be coming back to Seattle and hope I can book this place again. \",\n",

There were a ton of great bars and restaurants right on the same street as the apartment. There is acutally a Speakeasy right next door which was a very cool way to end the evenings and the sound was never too bad at all. Great place to stay and would definitely stay again or refer to good friends. \",\n",

If you are a young, hip couple that is going to be out until 2:30am anyways, this is perfect for you.  Otherwise, be forewarned from 10pm to 2am, you will be awake.  ',\n",

Amanda and Cory could not have made themselves more available – they ensured everything ran smoothly for us and as mentioned in previous reviews, they left awesome recommendations for sights, hikes, restaurants, bars and things to do. They left us cream, and everything set up to make coffee or tea upon our arrival. We stayed for a week and were never in need of anything - the apartment was very clean and comfortable; everything was provided (even a hairdryer, which I forgot!) The bar next door didn’t disturb us at all and they left ear plugs for us as well. The restaurant downstairs (Pintxo) is phenomenal, we ate there more than once. \\r\\nTheir place is in a great location, we didn’t need to take a cab once during our stay, they were walking distance to almost every major neighborhood/area (Seattle ctr, downtown, pioneer sq, capitol hill, centrally located in Belltown) and literally just a few minutes from the waterfront & Pike Place Market. They’re on the same block as a lot of landmark restaurants/bars in Belltown as well. I highly recommend them as hosts and their location to stay when visiting Seattle! \\r\\n',\n",

In fact the bar staff were very concerned that if we thought it was noisy to let them know.    Amanda and Cory could not be more gracious hosts.

Amanda was waiting for me with the keys upon my arrival!  As many have mentioned - the studio is in a great location - easily accessible to anywhere either within walking or public transit.  Public Market and ferries 10 minutes away.  And easily accessible to stadiums to catch a Mariners or Seahawks game.  And if you want to get into a bit of nature within the city, take bus 43 to the northern end of the Washington Arboretum, walk through to the southern end to the Japanese Garden, then take Bus 11 back into downtown (or vice versa).  So very beautiful!  The Apartment is exactly like the photo - bed is very comfortable, great water pressure and hot water in shower - everything is provided.

It was fine for our needs because we were out and about the majority of every day and evening, but earplugs were definitely required for sleeping if you retire before the bar closes (the hosts provide earplugs).

       " \"We had a great stay! Cory and Amanda were very helpful and always quick to respond to us. The apartment was in a great location and very clean. The only downside was that it is right beside a bar which is super noisy as bars are. It didn't bother us much but if you're a light sleeper it's probably not a great for for you. I would definitely stay here again if I were back in Seattle. \",\n",
       " 'The positive experience with Cory and Amanda started before we even arrived. Although their place is very close to many downtown destinations, they recommended against taking Link into the city after our 10 p.m. arrival.\\n\\nChecking in (and out) was a very easy process. The place was spacious for a studio, clean and very well-appointed, and even had a hair dryer, soft drinks and water (website hidden) noise, while present, was not a factor at any point. (Wed. - Fri.)',\n",
       " \"The apartment is ideally located in the Belltown section of Seattle, near to many restaurants, music venues etc.  Inside, everything is neat and clean and well thought out, from the whistling teapot to the provided coffee to the filtered water in the fridge.  We lacked for nothing and had a most comfortable overnight stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended and the owners were most accommodating and responsive to communications.  Our only regret was that this was just a quick overnight due to our schedule and we didn't have lots of time to just relax and enjoy the space and the neighborhood.  \\r\\n\\r\\nParking is street or lot; we had no problem finding an overnight lot within a block or so over on 1st Avenue.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

       " \"This apartment was absolutely fantastic for our stay in Seattle. Cory and Amanda were more than accommodating and so helpful throughout the entire stay. They helped us with suggestions for transportation, restaurants, and even allowed us to store our bags for part of the last day so we could enjoy every minute of our trip. I felt welcome and comfortable texting them with questions and for help. Even their employees at the restaurant (Pintxo) and The Upstairs were kind, courteous and helpful, making us feel even more at home. The apartment is in the most ideal location. We were able to walk to every site we were hoping to see and even found a ton more to see and enjoy in the neighborhood that we didn't even know we'd find! The apartment itself was adorable, comfortable and had every amenity we needed...and then some! Cory and Amanda have thought of everything! I plan on staying here on my next visit (visits) to Seattle, and would highly suggest it to anyone traveling and site seeing in Seattle. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you again for a fantastic stay! :) \",\n",

It is indeed right next to a bar upstairs, and at night on the weekend you can hear the music and activity almost as if you were in the bar itself.  We tended to stay up late so it wasn't a problem, but it's good to consider.  The location was perfect as it is within walking distance of so many coffee shops, restaurants, and attractions.  Amanda met us at the apartment on our first day, and the staff of the Upstairs Bar and Pintxo downstairs were also very friendly and helpful when we had questions.  Highly recommended!\",\n",
       " \"What an amazing place! Setting everything up with Amanda was easy and Cory was very friendly when we met so I could pick up the keys. He gave us a lot of great tips for our one night in Seattle! We also liked the access to the parking space. Both Cory and Amanda were very accessible too.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur favorite part of this place was The Upstairs bar next to the apartment. We were only in town for the evening before catching a flight and it was the perfect place to settle in for the night after some barhopping-- just a quick walk next door. The drinks were phenomenal and the atmosphere was chill--great music choices too. We didn't get to try the restaurant downstairs because we got back too late, but you can bet we'll be there the next time we visit! \",\n",
       " 'Everything was great. The apt is just like the pictures.They responded very quickly. The apartment is centralized and a couple min to EVERYTHING. We met Cory when we received the keys he was very informative and let us know about a couple places to visit. Overall we would definitely stay at c&a place again if we had the pleasure to revisit this beautiful city! ',\n",
       " 'This darling apartment was the perfect base for our weekend in Seattle. It is absolutely central to all the best that Seattle has to offer--Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, and amazing restaurants and music venues. We parked our car and walked everywhere! The apartment was cozy and clean, very cool artwork and lots of information on what to do in Seattle. We met Cory on check-in and he had great suggestions about what to do on our first night (karaoke at Hula Hula!); we also ran into both Amanda and Cory throughout the weekend and they were super gracious and friendly. \\n\\nIf you stay here I definitely recommend making reservations at Pintxo, and save some room in your budget for The Upstairs--incredible drinks, awesome atmosphere. The only drawback to the apartment sharing a wall with The Upstairs is the noise level; but the hosts provide ear plugs and that worked fine for me. If you are an early-to-bed, light-sleeper kinda person, this might not be the right place for you to stay. We will definitely consider staying here again the next time we visit Seattle!',\n",

       " \"This place was awesome! It was a great location right in the middle of Belltown walking distance to  anything you desire. The bar right next door provided the perfect atmosphere for when I got back at night to relax and meet Seattle locals to learn about the town. The place had a lot more space then I expected from the pictures. The bed was comfy with tons of blankets and pillows. The shower was nice and hot. I was there for work so I didn't spend much time in the place but it was still great. I definitely will stay here again next time I come to town. \",\n",
       " 'Cory and Amanda were fantastic hosts! They openly communicated with us each step of our trip, which made arrival very easy. Check-in wasn\\'t until 4pm, but they allowed us to drop off our bags early so we could enjoy the city. They also left a list of suggestions for local restaurants, bars and shops. The neighborhood is great - very lively at all hours of the day and night, but it wasn\\'t disturbingly loud. We were able to grab a drink and dinner at 10pm on a Monday night just across the street from the apartment, which was great as we were trying to spend as much time as possible exploring the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bed in the apartment is ridiculously comfortable! I think almost every night we came in and passed out within seconds :) The bar next door never posed an issue for us in terms of noise. However, my boyfriend and I are pretty heavy sleepers. For the lighter sleepers, there is a shot glass of earplugs by the bedside. The unit was a bit cold (our stay was in mid-February), but they have an electric space heater for when the radiator just isn\\'t doing the trick. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe unit is a studio, and I think that\\'s important for future guests to remember that this is a studio, and the space is small. There isn\\'t much room to hang clothes - maybe about eight hangers. The bathroom is also very tiny - I was bumping my elbows while washing my hair. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, we loved our stay - the apartment came equipped with everything we needed and was adorably decorated! We were so tired each night that we never had a chance to try their bar next door, \"The Upstairs,\" but it looked fun! We had dinner at \"Pinxto\" downstairs one night, and that was delicious!',\n",
       " \"What a great location to stay at! Steps from Pike Place market and only minutes to lots of great places to eat and drink. The apartment has everything you would need and Cory and Amanda are great hosts.

Otherwise, no complaints!\",\n",

The apartment was very nice and everything was as advertised.  The location is particularly great and you can walk anywhere in the city within minutes.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing I would mention, which others have noted as well, is that the apartment shares a wall with the upstairs bar.  Saturday night was pretty loud but we are relatively heavy sleepers.  If you are a light sleeper, you might want reconsider.  The staff in the bar and the restaurant downstairs were awesome.  We would definitely stay there again!!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

Netflix on a giant flat screen TV. Well-equipped kitchen with coffee and creamer. So many nice touches. The apartment is literally next door to the bar and you can hear low voices and clinking glasses. I liked that. Ideal location. Go to Shorty's across the street for beers and pinball. Blocks from Pike Place. Highly recommended. \",\n",
       " 'If you are looking for an urban city escape in the middle of a \"foodie\" town, this place is PERFECT! We stayed for 5 days and loved this stylish flat.  Immaculately clean. Great location in the center of Beltown (walk to everything) but yet very private. Thoughtful hosts provided everything we needed (plus extras too: Netflix, laundry detergent, blowdryer, umbrellas, etc). It rained for 2 straight days while we were there and it was nice to simply do a load of laundry and have fresh clean dry clothes again. Future renters should be aware this block becomes super trendy on the weekends so the noise level gets higher. No problem for us though, we were active participants and enjoyed the music! The hosts Amanda and Cory were very welcoming. Amanda, especially always greeted us with a huge smile. The location is easy to get to using public transportation from the airport (light rail). We arrived 1 hr prior to check in and they let us store our bags so we could continue exploring the city. Pike\\'s Place Market only 2 blocks away. Lots of food choices for every budget. There is an overbundance of microbreweries and you can get a great cup of coffee just about anywhere. Highly recommended. ',\n",
       " 'The hosts were fantastic in providing info about food and bars in the area. They were exceptionally responsive to inquires and and very helpful in working around my constantly changing check-in time. The place itself was a bit older than I expected from the pictures but it did not impact our stay. I wish the record player was out so I could relax to some music but the stereo provided did the trick. We had three total and were staying almost a full week. This studio apt is definitely more suited for two people, especially for that length of time, but the hosts did a great job of preparing for three people. \\r\\nThe noise was quite excessive on the weekend because the longest wall is shared with a bar. Music was the main culprit for the loss of sleep but the people were relatively considerate. During the week there was not much noise at all and the ear plugs certainly helped.\\r\\nAll in all, the place was very well located and provided the needed amenities for a more lengthy stay but the noise was certainly a factor and the space could be updated. I left satisfied with my stay!  ',\n",

It's in a great neighborhood with many, many great bars, restaurants, etc. and an easy walk to Pike Place and all the downtown attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's worth noting that one of the aforementioned funky bars does share a wall with the bedroom. This was not a problem for us (we're heavy sleepers, and we just went next door to enjoy the bar--which is a deeply cool establishment and should not be missed). But anyone hoping to hit the hay early should consider this; you will hear the music from next door (earplugs were thoughtfully provided).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts were super accommodating and flexible--cool folks.

As the posting said, the apartment is literally next door form a bar but don't be worried because it is not loud, and if for some reason you needed complete silence, there are earplugs in the nightstand and that will completely do it.

Checking in was totally painless and easy, and we found the apartment clean and welcoming.

The place itself is bigger than I images from the pictures. we loved the open floor plan and it was extremely clean. \\n\\nWe were there on a Friday night and had no issues with the noise level. \\n\\nIf your mission is to explore the city of Seattle, I highly recommend this place.\",\n",
       " 'Great place to stay in the heart of Seattle!  The apartment had everything we needed!',\n",
       " \"Cory and Amanda were amazing hosts and I can't imagine having an easier time for my first stay using AirBNB.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment was exactly as advertised and they went above and beyond with keeping the apartment stocked with any utility items I could of possibly needed. The location is also superb if your goal is to experience downtown Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI used  my stay here through Airbnb as a trial run and I can say that thanks to my experience here I will definitely be using it again.\",\n",
       " \"My stay was great and Cory and Amanda did a great job having the place ready ahead of the standard check-in time of 4. It was a great location in downtown Seattle and was a short walk to all of Seattle's attractions. I would recommend this location to anyone interested in visiting the heart of Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Adam and Tawnya\",\n",
       " 'Cory and Amanda were awesome, willing to accommodate an earlier arrival in the day than initially planned and offering a ton of local hotspot suggestions for us on the table. The neighborhood was amazing and the home could not be more centrally located. Place was well-kept and great looking, highly recommended.',\n",
       " 'Great homey place to stay in the heart of Seattle! Amanda and Cory were very helpful with our silly questions... and very generous... the apartment is adorable!',\n",

       " 'very nice to stay here for some days.  The apartment is beautiful and quite comfortable. And very good location near pike market. Thank you.',\n",
       " \"Our stay in Seattle was absolutely perfect thanks to Cory & Amanda! Their place was the perfect size for my wife and I during our short stay.  The location in the middle of Belltown could not have been better - we walked everywhere and didn't need to take an Uber or taxi once.  There is definitely noise from the bar next door in the evenings, but not even close to something that would've bothered us, and our thoughtful hosts had a noise machine and earplugs by the bed in case you're an extra sensitive sleeper or aren't used to city night life. Being in such a prime location in the neighborhood and sharing the building with local businesses was definitely the thing that made this place unique.  If you want to truly experience Seattle, and not in a typical touristy way, staying here is a great start.\",\n",
       " 'Great apartment in the perfect location for walking all over Seattle. We loved our stay! Apartment was the perfect size and very comfortable.  Having the white noise machine was brilliant and necessary! The Upstairs was cozy and a cool place for a drink. Great restaurants in the area as well.',\n",
       " 'Cory and Amanda were friendly and accommodating. Amanda gladly met us earlier than scheduled for a check-in. Her food recommendations were spot-on, among the favorites of our trip! The apartment was cozy, just right for two of us. And the kitchen was well-equipped . . . we enjoyed cooking fresh fish from Pike Place Market! The location was ideal; we walked to everything. And having a speakeasy-style bar right next to us just added to the edgy feel of the place. Loved the craft cocktails! Overall, a great stay. Felt like locals the whole time. ',\n",
       " 'First ever AirBnb experience was a great success with Cory and Amanda! Very friendly and easy to reach! The apartment location was also outstanding, close to everything— food, drinks, tourist destinations, etc! I would definitely stay here again :) ',\n",
       " \"Cory and Amanda was so accommodating and friendly. I arrived in Seattle in the morning and they were kind enough to allow me to store my luggage at the place until the apartment was ready. I couldn't have asked for a better area to stay in. There were so many restaurants and bars within walking distance. Even better, Cory and Amanda's Spanish tapas restaurant was located directly downstairs, while their bar was located literally next door. During the night, the music from the bar does carry through, but they supplied us with ear plugs. We didn't even use them as we are heavy sleepers and the sound didn't bother us, but I could see how light sleepers would not like it. The apartment included a lot of amenities like shampoo, conditioner, body wash, cotton swabs, floss, and toothpaste. They even had books and magazines about Seattle. There were also pots and pans to cook, although with so many great restaurants nearby, we didn't bother. Since it was my birthday celebration, Cory and Amanda had a bottle of Spanish wine waiting for me when I arrived. It goes to show how thoughtful they are!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an issue about a water inspection that required access to the apartment, but we were out exploring Seattle anyways and it was no big deal to me, but Amanda was so apologetic that she offered us a free (email hidden). Although it was unnecessary, I really appreciated the gesture and it shows how much they want their guests to have a great experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the perfect place for my first visit to Seattle and I will definitely be coming back. I hope I will get to stay at their place again! Thanks Cory and Amanda!\",\n",
       " \"Very pleasant stay in the heart of the city! Great to get immersed into Seattle's vibrant atmosphere. Several points to note: 1) Location is fantastic! You are just minutes away from Pike Place market and Belltown itself has great variety of places to eat, have a drink, etc. also you are very close to Olympic Park by the water which is great for jogging or taking a bike ride 2) Apartment itself is very atmospheric -  a lot of reading on the city, collection of photographs, paintings, etc. 3) check-in & check-out very smooth 4) you are next to the bar and in a very lively area - think of listening to live music from the place down the road when going to bed - for me personally it was perfect and added to the overall experience of staying in Seattle \",\n",
       " \"Amanda and Cory's place was amazing! Looked exactly like the pictures and was in the perfect location for amazing food and sight seeing. It was exactly what we needed for our honeymoon!\",\n",
       " 'Yes, we were made welcome.  Cory & Amanda are attentive hosts.  The flat is characterful and the location is great:  central for many Seattle activities.',\n",
       " 'We do not have enough room to describe how much we loved this studio! The space was so charming and perfect for the two of us! The speakeasy next door was one of the absolute high lights of our trip... Great drinks, amazing atmosphere and a convenient place to start and end our evenings! The bartenders Adam, Andy, and Jonathan were so welcoming and helpful! Amanda greeted us with a smile and was helpful with any questions. The neighborhood could not be more perfect for a Seattle experience and is minutes away from bars, restaurants, pike place market and so much more! This was one of our favorite airbnb spaces ever.  We are so looking forward to our next stay! ',\n",
       " \"Perfect place to stay in the downtown area. Short walking distance from the big sights (Pikes market, space needle) and lively night life all around. The tapas bar downstairs and the bar next door were tasty and fun options for anybody looking to stay close to home. Couldn't pick a better place in downtown to stay.\",\n",
       " 'Cory and Amanda were wonderful hosts. They were accommodating and the check in/out process was very easy. The apartment is located in a great neighborhood - walking distance to many tourist areas and great restaurants. The Upstairs bar was great and we really enjoyed going there as well. Would definitely stay here again. ',\n",
       " \"Cory and Amanda were wonderful hosts! The check-in process was seamless and they were very attentive throughout our whole stay. The apartment was very cute and the location was perfect. Next to lots of fun bars and restaurants and just a short walk to Pike's Place market. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle!\",\n",
       " 'My friend and I came to Seattle for a birthday weekend trip and decided to stay in Belltown to get an \"authentic\" Seattle experience. Cory and Amanda were very helpful from the start. They emailed me suggestions for places to eat and things to do. We arrived pretty late on a Friday but one of the staff members from their restaurant let us into the apartment. (Btw, Pintxo is pretty tasty, and the upstairs bar has an awesome atmosphere and great drinks!). \\n\\nThe apartment itself had everything we needed and had fun, funky decor. The bed was so comfortable that I literally took the sheets off before I left to check what mattress it was. Location of the apartment was perfect, walking distance to multiple delicious restaurants (try Local 360), shops, Pike Place Market, etc. we also walked to/from Pioneer Square a couple of times, which was a nice 30 min walk but definitely doable.\\n\\nOnly a few drawbacks: \\n- The bar next door is loud and stays open until 2am on the weekend. The hosts provide ear plugs, and we had no trouble sleeping the one night that we did not shut the bar down ;)\\n- The bathroom is a bit tight, including the shower and sink area. Would definitely be hard for more than one person to get ready in the bathroom at once.\\n\\nOther than that, great apartment! ',\n",
       " \"Cory and Amanda's place was wonderful! Located within walking distance to much of Seattle's sights and dining, it was the perfect place for my short two night stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nTheir space is very comfortable and had more than enough amenities for a stay that long, including a washer/dryer, apple tv and umbrellas. \\r\\n\\r\\nCommunication was excellent also; very timely and always courteous. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will definitely consider them next time I am in Seattle and highly recommend them to anyone.\",\n",
       " \"We had an amazing stay with Cory and Amanda!  Communication was pretty much immediate, and always happy and pleasant.  We felt so welcome, from the very first email communication.  Once we arrived, we found the space to be so warm and comfortable, the perfect place for us.  So clean, and had everything we needed.  Location?  Amazing.  I can't say enough about our experience - overwhelmingly positive!  We can't wait to come back to Seattle, and stay right here again.   \",\n",
       " \"Great communication from the hosts before, throughout, and after our stay. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. The place is beautiful. There's plenty of space for a couple. The bed is unbelievably comfortable with lots of extra pillows and blankets available. There's lots of little extras, like a magazine rack full of Seattle publications, a coffee/tea station, earplugs + white noise generator, and an AM/FM radio. And what a location! Dozens of restaurants and bars are within a couple of blocks. There's even a cozy cocktail lounge literally next door (you don't even have to leave the building)! This apartment is a great find for anyone who enjoys nightlife and wants to stay in the heart of Seattle culture.\",\n",
