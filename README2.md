## Project: Seattle Washington, Summary

## Question: What Factors Influence Airbnb Reviews
### How do those reviews compare with locations of crime in the city?

## Goal: Visually Represent Locations of Airbnb Rentals Relative to Review, as well as Crime

### Data:

I gathered my data from Kaggle, and from searching different websites for data relating to Seattle, Washington.  The original data I started with was from the Pronto Cycle Share company's data set that was on Kaggle.com.  After starting by examining this data, I found date from Airbnb on Kaggle as well.  I initially found a dataset from Kaggle that had crime data from Seattle, WA, but I looked online and found other options, although ended up going to a different Kaggle dataset with 1.4 million responses from 2009 onwards.
